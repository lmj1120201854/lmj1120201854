# Hi, I'm Li Meiju ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about deep learning, multi-modal alignment, and building universal strategies for multi-modal tasks. Here's a little bit about me:

---

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- **Multi-modal Alignment**: Exploring ways to effectively align multiple modalities for better understanding and decision-making.
- **Universal Multi-modal Strategies**: Developing strategies that can generalize across different modalities for various AI tasks.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- **Baidu PaddlePaddle**: Diving deep into the PaddlePaddle framework to build more efficient and scalable deep learning models.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- Best practices in multi-modal learning
- Improving performance of models in real-world applications
- Optimization techniques for deep learning frameworks

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, backpropagation, optimization methods.
- **Multi-modal Systems**: How to combine and align different types of data (images, text, speech, etc.)
- **PaddlePaddle**: Insights on using the Baidu PaddlePaddle deep learning framework.
